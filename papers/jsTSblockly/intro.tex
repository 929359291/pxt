\section{Introduction}

Blockly~\cite{Blocky2015} is a JavaScript framework for creating visual block-based editing environments, 
inspired by MITâ€™s Scratch programming environment~\cite{ScratchCACM2009}.  Visual blocks represent structured 
control-flow statements such as while loops and if-then-else conditionals, as well as expressions. 
Blocks also represent function calls to domain-specific APIS. Blocky supports the creation of \emph{custom 
blocks} for domain-specific APIs. Blockly can be compiled to a variety of languages, the main target 
being JavaScript. 

TypeScript is superset of the JavaScript language that is gradually typed, meaning that types may 
optionally be added to JavaScript code to provide for a more productive programming and debugging experience. 
We describe a mapping from TypeScript annotated APIs to Blockly that radically simplifies 
the creation of domain-specific Blockly-based programming environments  This makes it very easy 
to take existing JavaScript frameworks and libraries, many of which already have TypeScript 
descriptions of their APIs, and make them available via Blockly.

    There are many JavaScript libraries for building solutions for a 
    wide range of problems, but it's not easy for novices to harness their power.  
    The Blockly framework allows the creation of domain-specific 
    programming environments for novices that greatly reduces the potential
    for syntax and semantic errors through the use of visual blocks. We show how the TypeScript
    programming language, a gradually typed superset of JavaScript, can be used
    to bridge the jap between JavaScript and Blockly. In particular, we define
    a mapping from the type system of TypeScript into Blockly that makes it simple
    to create a domain-specific Blockly editor for a JavaScript library via a 
    TypeScript declaration file.

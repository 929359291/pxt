\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluate}

This section evaluates the costs of the various layers of abstraction in our platform.
using a set of micro-benchmarks. These programs were written
in both C++ and Static TypeScript, and evaluated on
three microcontrollers (Table~\ref{table:devices}): nRF51 (micro:bit),
SAMD21 (CPX device), and Atmega (Uno). The C++ benchmarks isolate the performance
of \CO and provide a baseline, while the Static TypeScript benchmarks show the overhead
added by \MC.

\subsection{Software \& Devices}

The C++ of our platform breaks into two essential layers:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\CO}: the device runtime, against which we write C++ programs;
\item \emph{\MC wrappers}: the C++ and Static TypeScript wrapping for \CO
to make it known to \MC, against which we write Static TypeScript programs;
\end{itemize}
We refer to \emph{\MC wrappers} as \MC throughout the evaluation.

\MC and \CO currently operates on three different devices (Table~\ref{table:devices}), each with varying capabilities. The simplest device is the Uno, consisting of an 8-bit processor running at 48 MHz, it only has 2kB of RAM (a thousandth of the amount a smartphone has in 2017) and 32kB of flash. The Uno has no onboard components other than the microcontroller which supports GPIO, Serial, and I2C.

The micro:bit has a 32-bit Cortex M0 clocked at 16MHz, with 16kB RAM and 256kB of flash. It has a number of onboard components including a 5x5 LED matrix display, a compass, accelerometer, buttons, GPIO, I2C, Serial, and Bluetooth Low Energy.

The CircuitPlayground is a 32-bit Cortex-M0+, which offers greater energy efficiency and performance; it clocks at 48 MHz, has 32kB of RAM and 256kB of flash. On board the CircuitPlayground are: RGB pixels, an infrared transmitter and receiver, a touch sensor, buttons, accelerometer, speaker, microphone, GPIO, I2C, and Serial.

The Uno and micro:bit \MC targets use the untagged strategy, while the CircuitPlayground target takes the tagged strategy (see Section~\ref{sec:untagged-tagged}).

\subsection{Methodology}

To analyse the performance of our solution, we have written a suite of programs to evaluate different aspects of the platform. Although the content of the programs differs, the approach remains the same:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Performance Analysis}: Tests that capture time taken to perform an operation will toggle a GPIO before executing the operation, execute the operation, and toggle the GPIO at the end of the operation. Using an oscilloscope attached to the board, we determine the real time taken to perform that operation.

    \item \textit{Memory Analysis}: Tests that capture the RAM footprint of a certain operation will print a map of memory before executing the operation, execute the operation, and print a map of memory at the end of the operation. A serial terminal is used to capture the output of these tests.
\end{enumerate}

It is important to note that memory and performance analysis are done in separate runs, as outputting data over a serial port directly affects time-related tests.

\subsection{The Overhead of \MC}

To place the overhead of \MC in context, we perform a comparitive evaluation of \MC against fully virtualised solutions, using the native C++ as our baseline. The two points of comparison are MicroPython~\cite{MicroPython}, an implementation of Python for microcontrollers, and Espruino~\cite{espruinoBook}, an implementation of JavaScript for micrcontrollers. For the CircuitPlayground, a fork of MicroPython  known as 'CircuitPython' was used.

We created a program to give the cost of each solution with respect to time. The program counts from 0 to 100000 in a tight loop, toggling a GPIO just before the loop starts and immediately after it terminates; we measured the loop's duration using an oscilloscope. The program was rewritten in each solutions' respective language; the results are shown in Table~\ref{table:vm-comparison}.

For the micro:bit, micropython and Espruino are an order of magnitude slower than a native \CO program, while \MC is only 114 milliseconds slower. However, \MC for the CircuitPlayground uses the tagged approach, and completes in the same time as a micro:bit whilst executing instructions three times as fast. For both devices, \MC outperforms both the VM-based solutions of MicroPython and Espruino.

\subsection{Context Switch Performance}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \includegraphics[width=.7\columnwidth]{images/context-switch.png}
\caption{\label{fig:context-switch}Base context switch profiles per device.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \includegraphics[width=.78\columnwidth]{images/context-vs-stack.png}
\caption{\label{fig:context-vs-stack}Time taken to perform a context switch against stack size.}
\end{figure}

To evaluate the performance of \CON's scheduler we conducted a test that created two fibers and continuously swapped context; in each fiber a GPIO was toggled, enabling us to capture the duration using an oscilloscope. We performed this test in both \MC and \CO and the resulting profiles can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:context-switch}. This figure breaks the context switch down into three phases: (1) \CO, the time it takes to perform a context switch in \CO; (2) Stack, the time taken to page out the \MC stack; and (3) \MC, the overhead added by the \MC layer. For the uno, the context switch profile is for the native implementation only.

Figure~\ref{fig:context-vs-stack} profiles the time a context switch takes with an increasing stack size across all three devices in \CO. This test is similar to the previous test, however, we placed bytes (in powers of 2) on the stack of each fiber, starting from 64 and finishing at 1024. The difference in gradients, and ranges of values can be put down to device capability. For instance, the Uno has an 8-bit processor word size, which means more instructions are required to copy the stack, therefore as the stack size increases, so does context switch time.

\subsection{Asynchronous Operation Performance}

    \end{tabular}
\caption{\label{table:time-ram-consumption}RAM consumption and processing time for various asynchronous operations in \CO.}
\end{table}

To gauge the cost of different asynchronous operations in \CON, we tested three commonly used code paths using the CircuitPlayground: (1) creating a fiber; (2) handling a non-blocking procedure call; and (3) handling a blocking procedure call. Table~\ref{table:time-ram-consumption} presents our results. These code paths are used to invoke handlers for events with corresponding listeners, central to \CO and \MC.

In \CO, creating a fiber costs 136 bytes and 35.4 microseconds, a non-blocking procedure call costs 32 bytes and 4.01 microseconds, and a blocking procedure call costs 204 bytes and 32.4 microseconds. Queuing an event takes an additional 28.87 microseconds, plus the cost of either invoke.

A naiive approach to multithreading would execute event handlers in separate fibers. In \CO, we invoke functions in the context of the current fiber until it is no longer possible to do so (i.e. the user has performed a blocking operation). For non-blocking calls, the best case, this has an small overhead of 32 bytes of RAM and is not processor intensive, versus the worst case, which incurs a large overhead of 204 bytes of RAM and 32.4 microseconds of processor time.

\end{tabular}

\caption{\label{table:flash-consumption}The total flash consumption of code required to support \MC.}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{table:flash-consumption} shows the per device flash consumption of each software library used in the final \MC binary. To obtain these numbers, we profiled the final map file produced after compilation. The ordering of the table aligns with the composition of the software layer: \MC builds on \CO which builds on the C++ standard library and optionally, mbed.

From the bottom up, the profile of the standard library changes dramatically for each device: The Uno has a very lightweight standard library; the microbit uses 64-bit integer operations (for timers) which requires extra standard library functions; and the CircuitPlayground requires virtualised floating point operations pulling in more standard library functions.

Mbed is not used for the Uno as it does not have an ARM processor. Mbed is utilised for the micro:bit more than the CircuitPlayground as over time we have begun to phase it out in favour of native implementations.

The size of \CO and \MC scales linearly with the amount of functionality a device has, due to the component oriented nature of \CO and transitively \MC. For instance the Uno has few onboard components when compared to the CircuitPlayground and micro:bit.

The modular composition of \CO allows us to support multiple devices with a variety of feature sets, whilst maintaining the same API at the \MC layer.

\caption{\label{table:ram-consumption}The total static ram consumption of for an \MC binary.}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{table:ram-consumption} shows the per device ram consumption of each software library used in the final \MC binary. To obtain these numbers, we profiled the final map file produced after compilation.

At runtime MakeCode dynamically allocates memory: 1.56 kB for the CircuitPlayground, 560 bytes for the micro:bit, and 644 bytes for the Uno.

From the table, the micro:bit uses substantially more global space than \CO, yet the reverse is true for the other two devices. The micro:bit operates off of a slightly older code base from the other two devices, over time, we have begun to pull functionality added the \MC layer back down into codal.

For the CircuitPlayground, the globals consumption for \CO is slightly higher. Due to the extra RAM, an unusual luxury, we add a 1K serial buffer so that users can log large amounts of data if required.
% Add globals maps and profile of listener and fiber.

% The CPX runtime is the largest, as the CPX device has lots of on-board
% components, and this runtime shares much of its code with other SAMD21 \MC targets.
% The compiled C++ runtime is 114k in total, with \CO accounting for 29k, with an
% additional 15k from libmbed. The \MCN-common-packages adds 20k, and also in
% an additional 49k of math support libraries (floating point operations,
% including trigonometry and number printing/parsing).
% As the SAMD21 has 256k of flash, we did not worry about optimizing this runtime for space.

% On the Uno, which has 32k of flash, the much \MC runtime is 8k and \CO is 14k (since
% the Uno only requires basic GPIO, i2c and serial drivers), leaving 10k for user code.

% The TypeScript part of the runtime is 1060 statements on the CPX and 216 on the Uno.
% In our microbenchmarks, 99\% of that runtime is tree-shaken away.

\subsection{\MC Native vs. \MC VM}

Since the Uno is an extremely resource constrained device, the AVR VM was motivated by the need for high code density. Table~\ref{table:c-native-vm-stats} describes the difference in performance for the native implementation and the virtualised implementation with respect to a C++ benchmark. With low computational complexity, the VM performs similarly to native, however, introducing computational tasks causes the VM to operate up to 5 times slower than the native implementation.

% Since the Uno is an extremely resource constrained device, the AVR VM was specifically designed for high code density. The interpreter is implemented in assembly, always included with the program, and is around 0.5k. There are about 30 opcodes, some of which can take 1 or 2 byte arguments. There are also a few combined opcodes, representing a sequence of one argument-less opcode, and one with an argument, which improves code density by about 25\%. Opcodes are direct offsets into the code of the interpreter, speeding up execution. They operate on a stack (mainly for function calls) and a special scratch register. There is essentially no stack space overhead compared to native AVR compilation. The speed overhead is around 4x-5x (with respect to native) for computational tasks.

\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{Compiling Static TypeScript}

When compiling the Static TypeScript benchmarks and runtime with code shaking we obtain a generated code density of 37.5 bytes per statement on the CircuitPlayground, 60.8 on AVR native, and 12.3 on AVR VM. This excludes string literals (which don't change the picture significantly), but includes class vtables and number literals if any. Note that ARM and AVR native instructions are 2 bytes each, while AVR VM instructions are between 0.5 and 3 bytes.

When compiling, the entire TypeScript program, including the runtime, is
passed to the TypeScript (TS) language service for parsing. Then, only the remaining part of the program (after code shaking) is compiled to native code.
On a modern laptop, using Node.js, TS parsing and analysis takes about 0.1ms per statement, and \MC compilation to native code takes about 1ms per statement.
While the TS compiler has been optimized for speed, \MCN's native compilation process hasn't been. For example, the CircuitPlayground TS pass is dominated by compilation of the device runtime and takes about 100ms, whereas the \MC pass typically only includes a small user program and a small bit of the runtime, resulting in less than 100ms. Thus, typical compilation times are in the range of 200ms for user programs of \textbf{ABC-XYZ NUMBER MICHAL?} lines.

% Not really a result, more of a description of design, with an anecdotal comment about speed.

% should be moved further up and described alongside AVR VM vs. Native

% The AVR VM was specifically designed for high code density, since \CO
% leaves less than 10k for TS runtime and user code on the Uno. The interpreter is implemented in assembly, always included with the program, and is around 0.5k.
% There are about 30 opcodes, some of which can take 1 or 2 byte arguments. There are also a few combined opcodes, representing a sequence of one argument-less opcode, and one with an argument, which improves code density by about 25\%. Opcodes are direct offsets into the code of the interpreter, speeding up execution. They operate on a stack (mainly for function calls) and a special scratch register. There is essentially no stack space overhead compared to native AVR compilation. The speed overhead is around 4x-5x (with respect to native) for computational tasks.

Tom: add "maker" to intro

- Steve to work on conclusion, reminding readers of the three As
  and summarizing how we did

- Michal to make pass over eval
  - code size of VM
  - make clear performance of VM in computational context
  - tagged vs. untagged

- Running example: make clear that the CPXs are communicating via
  light emission and detection (novel feature of physical computing)

- add a sentence that the system has been deployed, with users
  across EU and North America (over the last year)
  - thousands???

- make sure to note that event block in screensnapshot comes from C++ code

- replace microcontroller by MCU (space)
- replace Static TypeScript by STS (space)
- replace basic.pause by loops.pause

- FINAL STEPs:
  - space (reduce the WA section -- too much!)
  - make tables and figures fit in margins

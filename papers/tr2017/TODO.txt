- Joe to make pass on abstract/introduction
- James to work on codal.tex to make examples align with Figure 1
- Tom and Michal to investigate David Whale examples
- table 2 needs caption
- need to explain micropython and Espruino, mention Espruino is JavaScript!!!
- performance methodology section
- describe up front, the different devices and what they use
  - micro:bit - integer only, untagged

- remove streams and stream Figure
- Figure 6 and 7 to align with Figure 1
- Running example: make clear that the CPXs are communicating via 
  light emission and detection (novel feature of physical computing)
- Related work: should cite and compare to TinyOS, which is pretty well-known

\subsection{Running Example}

Figure~\ref{fig:example} shows a program in the Static
TypeScript subset that implements a simple ``stopwatch'' timer
for the micro:bit.
The program has three top-level statements:
the first initializes the global variable \emph{start} (line 1); the
second registers an event handler (lambda function) to execute
each time button A of the micro:bit is pressed (line 3); the
third registers a lambda to run forever on a fiber (line 18),
to animate the micro:bit's 5x5 LED screen whenever the timer is active. 

Note that this program is a JavaScript program, as there are no 
types mentioned explicitly. However, all the functions called in
this program are part of the runtime and are explicitly
typed.  As a result, the static type of every variable and expression
can be inferred by TypeScript's type inference.

The program also shows off the use of the non-preemptive concurrency
model supported by both \MC (for JavaScript) and \CO (for C++). 
The fiber running the forever statement executes the lambda inside a ``while (true)'' 
loop that yields (via a call to \emph{basic.pause}) after each call to the lambda.
This gives the button-press event handler a chance to execute
upon user input (in a separate fiber). Although the global variable \emph{start} is 
shared by the two fibers, there is no data race due to the non-preemptive 
scheduling model.

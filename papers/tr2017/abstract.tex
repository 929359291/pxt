    Over the last decade, microcontrollers, the low-power low-cost workhorses of embedded systems, 
    are increasingly used in making and education. Furthermore, use of microcontrollers is growing due to
    demand for devices to monitor and control systems (e.g., Internet of Things, home automation).
    However, one generally needs a professional development environment 
    and substantial programming skills to develop applications for microcontrollers. 
    
    We present a new open source platform for programming of microcontroller-based devices, with the goal
    of making it easy for \emph{anyone} to participate in creating with microcontrollers from 
    most \emph{anywhere} (a computer with a modern web browser and a USB port). 
    We evaluate the performance of the platform on devices ranging from the Arduino Uno
    to the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, popular boards used in making and creating. 
    We describe how the platform has been architected to 
    make it easy to port to a wide range of microcontollers (in the limit, \emph{anything}).

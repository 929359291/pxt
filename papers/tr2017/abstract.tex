\begin{abstract}
    Over the last decade, microcontrollers, the workhorses of embedded systems, have become
    central to efforts in making and education.  Microcontroller-based devices are small,
    low-power, inexpensive and programmable, which accounts for their huge growth. Typically,
    one needs a professional IDE and many programming skills to develop for such devices. 
    
    We present a new platform that simplifies the programming of microcontroller-based devices,
    to make it easy for anyone to participate in creating with microcontrollers from most any
    computer with a modern web browser. The platform supports visual block-based programming,
    and JavaScript in a web app with editors, simulator and complete compile chain that compiles 
    user code to binary in the browser. Static TypeScript, a subset of the TypeScript languge, 
    mediates between worlds of JavaScript and the C++ runtime for the microcontroller, 
    which is precompiled and cached in the web app. Both the JavaScript and C++ runtimes support
    an event-based programming model with support for non-preemptive fibers provides a simple starting 
    point for beginners, and progression to scenarios which benefit from concurrency. 

    We evalutate the performance of the open-source platform on devices ranging from the Arduino Uno
    to micro:bit and Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, popular boards used in making and creating
    arouind the world.

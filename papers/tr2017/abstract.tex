\begin{abstract}
    Microcontrollers, the low-power low-cost workhorses of embedded systems, see increasing use in making, education, and the Internet of Things.

    Traditionally, microcontrollers require additional software to load programs and programs are composed in low-level languages like C and C++. Given the rise of less traditional application domains, there is now a need to simplify the way we program them.

    We present a new programming platform that makes it easy for \emph{anyone} to program microcontrollers from \emph{anywhere}, using a computer with a modern web browser and a USB port (no native applications, C/C++ compilers, or drivers required).

    We describe how the platform has been architected to bridge the worlds of the Web, and a wide range of microcontrollers (\emph{anything}) via language, compiler, and runtime innovations.

    We evaluate the performance of the platform on devices ranging from small 8-bit processors with just 2kB of RAM, to more endowed processors.

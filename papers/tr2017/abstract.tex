\begin{abstract}
    Microcontrollers, the low-power low-cost workhorses of embedded systems, see increasing
    use in making and education, as well as market growth due to demand for devices to 
    monitor and control systems (e.g., home automation, Internet of Things).
    Given these trends, there is a need to simplify the programming and creation 
    of microcontroller-based systems

    We present a new programming platform that makes it easy for 
    \emph{anyone}, including beginners, to program microcontrollers from \emph{anywhere},
    namely a computer with a modern web browser and a USB port (no native applications, 
    C/C++ compilers, or drivers needed).
    We describe how the platform has been architected to bring together the worlds
    of the JavaScript web app and the microcontroller via language, compiler, and runtime innovations,
    as well as to simplify porting to a wide range of microcontrollers (\emph{anything}).
    We evaluate the performance of the platform on devices ranging from the Arduino Uno
    to the BBC micro:bit and Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, boards used in making and creating.

    Over the last decade, microcontrollers, the low-power low-cost workhorses of embedded systems, 
    are increasingly used in making and education. Furthermore, use of microcontrollers is growing due to
    demand for devices to monitor and control systems (e.g., Internet of Things, home automation).
    However, one generally needs a professional development environment 
    and substantial programming skills to develop applications for microcontrollers. 
    
    We present a new programming platform that makes it easy for 
    \emph{anyone} to program microcontrollers from a computer 
    with a modern web browser and a USB port (\emph{anywhere}). 
    We describe how the platform has been architected to bring together the worlds
    of the web and the microcontroller, via language, compiler, simulator, and runtime innovations. 
    We evaluate the performance of the platform on devices ranging from the Arduino Uno
    to the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, popular boards used in making and creating.

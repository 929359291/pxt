\begin{abstract}
    Over the last decade, microcontrollers, the workhorses of embedded systems, are finding
    use in making and education. Microcontroller-based devices
    are small, low-power, inexpensive and proliferating
    (for example, consider there use as IoT endpoints). However, one generally needs 
    a professional development environment and substantial programming skills to develop applications for such devices. 
    
    We present a new open source platform for programming of microcontroller-based devices, with the goal
    of making it easy for \emph{anyone} to participate in creating with microcontrollers from 
    most \emph{anywhere} (a computer with a modern web browser and a USB port). 
    We evaluate the performance of the platform on devices ranging from the Arduino Uno
    to micro:bit and Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, popular boards used in making and creating
    around the world. We describe how the platform has been architected to make it easy to port
    to a wide range of microcontollers (\emph{anything}).

%    The platform supports visual block-based programming,
%    and JavaScript in a web app with editors, simulator and complete compile chain that compiles 
%    user code to binary in the browser. Static TypeScript, a subset of the TypeScript languge, 
%    mediates between worlds of JavaScript and the C++ runtime for the microcontroller, 
%    which is precompiled and cached in the web app. Both the JavaScript and C++ runtimes support
%    an event-based programming model with support for non-preemptive fibers provides a simple starting 
%    point for beginners, and progression to scenarios which benefit from concurrency.

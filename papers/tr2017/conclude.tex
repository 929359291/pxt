\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

Hardware partners already have started to create MakeCode packages for the micro:bit.
Seeed Studio (\url{https://www.seeedstudio.com/}) has created packages to add its Grove components to a micro:bit.
Grove components are accessed via the I2C serial protocol, supported by the micro:bit device runtime.
All micro:bit packages for the Grove components are authored in Static TypeScript (gesture, ultrasonic-ranger,
4-digital-display, two-led-matrix). These packages can be found under GitHub user ``Tinkertanker'', prefixed with
``pxt-''. Sparkfun has created MakeCode packages for its micro:bit shields (GitHub user ``sparkfun'').
